# RISC-V Technical Working Groups

This repository holds charters, meeting minutes, planning documents, and other assets for the technical working groups within the RISC-V technical community. Each group must create a folder within this repo. Each folder should have the following files:

* README.md - a description of the group with a link to its code, documentation, and/or tests repo, if there is one, as well as the group's roadmap
* CHARTER.md - the preliminary or approved charter - see the Group policy for details
* MAINTAINERS.md - the chair, vice-chair, and any other maintainers for the group's repo(s)
* MINUTES - a subfolder with date-identified minutes from regular meetings

Please address any questions to help@riscv.org
